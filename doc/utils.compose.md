## compose() function

The `compose` function is a higher-order function that takes in any number of functions as arguments and returns a new function that applies each of the input functions in sequence, passing the output of one function as the input to the next. The `T extends Fn` syntax is a TypeScript generic type constraint that ensures that each input function has the same signature, taking in one argument and returning a value. The returned function takes in one argument and applies each of the input functions in sequence, returning the final output.

**Signature:**

```typescript
declare function compose<T extends Fn>(...fns: T[]): (arg: unknown) => unknown;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  fns | T\[\] |  |

**Returns:**

(arg: unknown) =&gt; unknown
